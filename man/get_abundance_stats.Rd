\title{Generate abundance statistics for OTUs}
\usage{
get_abundance_stats(filtered_OTU_file, abundance_stats_file)
}
\arguments{
\item{filtered_OTU_file}{Character string. Path to the filtered OTU table file (created in step 1.2).}

\item{abundance_stats_file}{Character string. Path where the abundance statistics will be saved.}
}
\value{
None. The function writes the abundance statistics to the specified output file.
}
\description{
Calculates summary statistics for each OTU to characterize its abundance and occupancy.
}
\details{
The function computes:
\enumerate{
\item Total abundance of each OTU across all samples
\item Abundance rank (where ties are given the same rank)
\item Occupancy (number of samples an OTU is present in)
\item Occupancy proportion as a percentage with rank
}
}
\note{
Original code provided output variable:  abundance_stats
}
\examples{
# Generate abundance statistics
get_abundance_stats(
  "output/Supplementary/Tables_in_SQL/OTU_abund.csv",
  "output/Supplementary/Tables_in_SQL/abundance_stats.csv"
)

}
